pygi-Hexed-wiget
================

Hex editor widget for pygi.

Editing not yet implemented, so the name is a little deceptive.
I plan on implementing that, but it's just part of a larger project,
where I don't really need editing yet.

TODO:
Add editing
Synchronization across widgets for:
  colorizing analyzed and unanalyzed blob areas
  specific block highlights
Code cleanup to get a better score from pylint
*Possibly* Add menu to the standalone example?

Notes:
It's a single .py file, so it probably doesn't need to be pip installed.
Just drop it in a project somewhere logical.
